## Bias and NLP

- Dirk Hovy & Shannon L. Spruit. [The Social Impact of Natural Language Processing](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-2096.pdf)
  - Motivation: "Instead, we want to move beyond privacy in our ethical analysis and look at the wider social impact NLP may have. In particular, we want to explore the impact of NLP on social justice, i.e., equal opportunities for individuals and groups (such as minorities) within society to access resources, get their voice heard, and be represented in society." (p.591)
  - New terms: "exclusion, overgeneralization, bias confirmation, topic under- and overexposure, and dual use." (p.592)
    - Exclusion: demographic bias (data side-effect) 
    - Overgeneralization & Bias confirmation: false positives -> overgeneralization & bias confirmation (modeling side-effect) "Would a false answer would be worsed than no answer?"
    - Topic underexposure -> availability heuristics -> discrimination
    - Topic overexposure -> Negative impact evaluation 
    - Dual use (unintended consequences)
